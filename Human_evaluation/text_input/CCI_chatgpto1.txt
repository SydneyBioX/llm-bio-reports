RESULTS
Our single‐cell transcriptomic and cell–cell communication analyses of nasopharyngeal (NS) and oropharyngeal (OG) brush samples from individuals with moderate or critical COVID‐19 revealed marked shifts in both the cellular landscape and intercellular signaling networks. Figure 1 (stacked bar plots) illustrates the relative abundance of major cell types in each sample, stratified by disease severity. Notably, critical COVID‐19 samples showed higher proportions of myeloid‐lineage cells (particularly Monocytes[a] and Neutrophils) and Basal epithelial cells[b], whereas T cells and B cells tended to be less abundant compared with moderate case[c]s. These findings are consistent with earlier reports showing an expansion of inflammatory myeloid populations and a reduction in adaptive lymphocytes in severe COVID‐19 (Liao et al., 2020[d]; Chevrier et al., 2021[e]).
To investigate how these compositional changes might reshape the inflammatory milieu, we performed a differential cell–cell communication analysis using a recently[f] developed ligand–receptor inference pipeline (Figure 2). The heatmap displays the net difference in communication strength (“Critical” minus “Moderate”) for each source–target cell‐type pair. Warmer (red) colors indicate stronger interactions in critical disease, whereas cooler (blue) colors represent weaker interactions. Strikingly, Basal cells exhibited the largest net increases in outgoing signals across multiple targets, including Basophil/Mast (difference = 0.25)[g][h], Ciliated (0.08), Dendritic (0.13), Macrophage (0.08), and T (0.10) cells. This pattern suggests an enhanced “alarm” or repair‐oriented function of basal epithelial cells under severe inflammatory stress, potentially reflecting basal cells’ progenitor role in airway epithelium regeneration.
In parallel, we observed strong upregulation of Monocyte → Macrophage communication (0.15)[i] and Macrophage → Monocyte crosstalk (0.09)[j] in critical disease, supporting a model in which recruited monocytes and activated macrophages engage in reciprocal signaling loops that may fuel excessive inflammation (Wynn & Vannella, 2016[k][l]). By contrast, we detected a strong reduction in Goblet → T cell communication (−0.25), implying that the mucosal epithelium may be less capable of stimulating local T‐cell responses in critical COVID‐19. Likewise, overall T‐cell interactions with other cell types trended downwar[m]d (e.g., T → Monocyte difference = −0.07[n]), aligning with the clinical observation of T‐cell dysfunction and depletion in severe disease (Mathew et al., 2020).
Taken together, these results highlight two principal phenomena. First, the airway epithelium in critical COVID‐19 harbors expanded Basal and pro‐inflammatory Myeloid populations, pointing to tissue injury and a compensatory, though potentially dysregulated, regenerative response. Second, there is a remapping of intercellular signaling networks that favors innate immune amplification while diminishing adaptive T‐cell–epithelial crosstalk.[o][p] Our findings align with previous studies indicating that severe disease correlates with hyperinflammatory innate responses and defective adaptive immunity (Liao et al., 2020; Chevrier et al., 2021). Furthermore, the observed upregulation of basal cell interactions with multiple immune cell types underlines their possible role as key orchestrators of the epithelial injury response in the upper airway.
Overall, our integrative single‐cell profiling underscores how severe SARS‐CoV‐2 infection reshapes both the cellular composition and the communication landscape in the upper respiratory tract. These quantitative data provide a mechanistic framework for understanding how the airway epithelial barrier and infiltrating immune subsets may together drive critical COVID‐19 pathology, offering potential targets for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies aimed at attenuating pathogenic epithelial–immune cross‐talk.[q]
