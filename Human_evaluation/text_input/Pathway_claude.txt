Neuronal Response to Spinal Cord Injury Shows Distinct Temporal Patterns
We performed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing on neurons from the mid-thoracic spinal cord of mice following spinal cord injury (SCI), examining transcriptional changes across seven time points: uninjured controls and 1 day, 4 days, 7 days, 14 days, 1 month, and 2 months post-injury (GEO accession: GSE234774). In total, we analyzed 17,340 [a]neurons (4,357 [b]uninjured and 12,983[c] injured) distributed across all time points, with 3 biological replicates per condition (Table 1).
Dimensionality reduction using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) revealed distinct clustering patterns between injured and uninjured neurons (Fig. 1A). The temporal progression of transcriptional changes following injury showed both shared responses and time-specific alterations (Fig. 1B). Notably, early time points (1d, 4d) occupied partially overlapping but distinct regions of the UMAP space compared to later recovery phases (1m, 2m), suggesting a progressive transcriptional reprogramming during the recovery process.
Temporal Gene Expression Changes Following Spinal Cord Injury
To identify genes with time-dependent expression changes following SCI, we performed differential expression analysis using a linear model that incorporated time as a continuous variable. This approach identified 2,897 genes[d] that changed significantly over time (adjusted p-value < 0.05). The top differentially expressed genes exhibited remarkably significant changes, with adjusted p-values of effectively zero for many genes (Table 2).
Interestingly, the majority of top differentially expressed genes, including Psap, Ctsb, Hexa, Itm2b, and Sdcbp, displayed negative log fold changes, indicating progressive downregulation over time following injury. The most significantly downregulated gene, Psap (Prosaposin), showed a log fold change of -0.0779, suggesting a consistent decline in expression across the post-injury time course. Prosaposin is involved in lysosomal function and neuroprotection, and its downregulation may reflect changing cellular priorities during the injury response (O'Brien et al., 1994[e]; Hiraiwa et al., 1997[f]).
Similarly, other significantly downregulated genes, such as Ctsb (Cathepsin B) and Hexa (Hexosaminidase A), are involved in lysosomal degradation pathways. Their coordinated downregulation suggests a potential reduction in lysosomal activity during the recovery phase, which may reflect changing metabolic demands or cellular priorities in injured neurons.
Pathway Analysis Reveals Divergent Biological Processes Between Up- and Down-regulated Genes
To gain insight into the biological significance of the time-dependent transcriptional changes, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on genes that were significantly up- or down-regulated over time. This analysis revealed strikingly different biological processes associated with each direction of expression change (Fig. 2).
Upregulated genes were significantly enriched for processes related to neuronal function and plasticity, including regulation of membrane potential (p.adjust = 3.9×10⁻³¹), dendrite development (p.adjust = 1.38×10⁻²⁵), vesicle-mediated transport in synapse (p.adjust = 2.75×10⁻²⁵), regulation of synaptic structure or activity (p.adjust = 4.13×10⁻²⁵), and postsynapse organization (p.adjust = 5.5×10⁻²⁵). These enriched pathways suggest that neurons progressively enhance their electrophysiological functions and synaptic connectivity during recovery from SCI, potentially contributing to neural circuit reorganization and functional restoration.
In contrast, downregulated genes were significantly enriched for immune and stress response pathways, including regulation of innate immune response (p.adjust = 2.7×10⁻¹⁷), positive regulation of response to biotic stimulus (p.adjust = 9.2×10⁻¹⁶), regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway (p.adjust = 1.81×10⁻¹⁵), alcohol metabolic process (p.adjust = 2.71×10⁻¹⁵), and response to endoplasmic reticulum stress (p.adjust = 3.6×10⁻¹⁵). This pattern suggests that inflammatory and stress responses are initially elevated following injury but progressively decrease over time, potentially reflecting resolution of acute inflammation and cellular stress as recovery progresses.
The contrasting functional profiles between up- and down-regulated genes highlight the complex and multifaceted nature of the neuronal response to SCI. While neurons appear to progressively downregulate inflammatory and stress responses, they simultaneously upregulate pathways related to neuronal function, plasticity, and connectivity. This coordinated transcriptional reprogramming may represent a transition from an initial damage response toward a regenerative program aimed at restoring neuronal function and connectivity.
Collectively, these results provide a comprehensive temporal map of transcriptional changes in spinal cord neurons following injury, revealing coordinated shifts in gene expression programs that may underlie the transition from acute injury response to long-term recovery and potential functional restoration.
