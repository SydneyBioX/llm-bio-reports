Cell Type Distribution Differs Between Moderate and Critical COVID-19 Patients
We analyzed single-cell RNA-sequencing data from nasopharyngeal and bronchial samples of COVID-19 patients, focusing on differences between moderate (n=14) and critical (n=13) disease severity. The dataset comprised 132,618 cells across 16,355 genes, allowing for high-resolution characterization of the airway transcriptional landscape.
Cell type composition analysis revealed distinct patterns between severity groups (Figure 1). While both moderate and critical patients exhibited diverse cellular populations in the airway, critical patients displayed notably higher proportions of neutrophils across multiple samples. Goblet cells appeared more predominant in moderate patients, whereas critical patients showed increased representation of monocytes and macrophages[a]. These shifts in cellular composition suggest severity-specific remodeling of the airway microenvironment during COVID-19 infection.
Cell-Cell Communication Analysis Reveals Severity-Specific Interaction Networks
To investigate potential intercellular signaling differences between severity groups, we performed cell-cell interaction (CCI) analysis using CellChat. This approach quantifies communication probability between cell types based on ligand-receptor expression patterns. The differential interaction map (Figure 2) revealed distinct communication networks associated with disease severity.
Critical COVID-19 samples exhibited significantly enhanced communication from monocytes to neutrophils (0.15 higher interaction probability) and from macrophages to neutrophils (0.08 higher[b][c]), suggesting intensified myeloid cell crosstalk in severe disease. Additionally, interactions from basal epithelial cells to other epithelial populations, particularly to basal cells themselves (0.25 higher), were markedly increased in critical samples, potentially indicating heightened epithelial repair mechanisms.[d]
Conversely, moderate COVID-19 samples displayed stronger interactions from goblet cells to T lymphocytes (0.25 higher interaction probability), suggesting more robust epithelial-lymphocyte communication in less severe disease. Communication from B cells to macrophages[e] was also elevated in moderate cases (0.14 higher), pointing to potentially more effective coordinated immune responses.
Ligand-Receptor Analysis Identifies Key Signaling Pathways in COVID-19 Severity
Moderate COVID-19: Goblet Cell-Immune Cell Communication
In moderate patients, we identified prominent goblet cell-initiated signaling to immune cells. The strongest goblet-to-neutrophil interaction involved ANXA1-FPR1 signaling (probability 0.49), a pathway known to promote resolution of inflammation (Sugimoto et al., 2016[f][g]). The goblet-to-T cell axis exhibited robust MHC class I-mediated communication (HLA-B/A/C-CD8A, probabilities 0.36-0.37), suggesting active antigen presentation and T cell recruitment. Additionally, MIF-(CD74+CD44) signaling from goblet to macrophages (probability 0.32) was prominent, potentially modulating macrophage inflammatory responses.
These interactions collectively suggest that in moderate COVID-19, goblet cells may orchestrate controlled immune responses through anti-inflammatory signaling (ANXA1-FPR1), coordinated T cell activation (HLA-CD8), and macrophage regulation (MIF-CD74), potentially contributing to more effective viral clearance without excessive inflammation.[h]
Critical COVID-19: Monocyte-Neutrophil Communication
Critical patients displayed distinct interaction patterns dominated by monocyte-to-neutrophil signaling. The highest probability interactions included ANXA1-FPR1 (0.35), CCL3-CCR1 (0.34), and CXCL3-CXCR2 (0.32). This chemokine-rich communication profile (including CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, CCL3, and CCL7) suggests extensive neutrophil recruitment and activation in severe disease. Additionally, proinflammatory mediators like IL1B-IL1R2 (0.29) featured prominently in these interactions.
The monocyte-neutrophil communication network in critical patients also involved adhesion-related signaling, including SPP1-ITGA5/ITGB1 (0.30), NAMPT-ITGA5/ITGB1 (0.28), and ICAM1-ITGAX/ITGB2 (0.22), suggesting enhanced neutrophil tissue infiltration. This extensive monocyte-neutrophil crosstalk, dominated by chemokine signaling and adhesion molecule interactions, likely contributes to excessive neutrophil recruitment and activity in critical COVID-19, potentially driving the hyperinflammatory state characteristic of severe diseas[i]e.
Integration of Cellular Communication Patterns
Comparing the cell-cell interaction landscapes between severity groups reveals a potential mechanism underlying COVID-19 pathophysiology. In moderate disease, goblet cell-driven communication to adaptive immune cells (T cells) appears to predominate, suggesting coordinated antiviral responses. Conversely, critical disease displays enhanced myeloid cell crosstalk, particularly between monocytes and neutrophils, potentially driving pathological inflammation.
The shift from epithelial-T cell communication to monocyte-neutrophil signaling parallels the transition from controlled to dysregulated inflammation observed clinically in severe COVID-19. The ligand-receptor profiles further support this paradigm, with anti-inflammatory mediators (ANXA1-FPR1 in an epithelial-immune context) characterizing moderate disease, while proinflammatory chemokines dominate critical disease.
These findings suggest that cellular communication networks may significantly influence COVID-19 disease trajectory, with balanced epithelial-adaptive immune crosstalk supporting resolution, while enhanced myeloid cell interactions potentially drive pathological inflammation in critical cases.
