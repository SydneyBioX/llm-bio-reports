Cell Type Composition in the METABRIC IMC Dataset
To establish a foundation for tumor cell classification, we began by examining the cellular landscape of 10 METABRIC breast cancer samples profiled using Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC). Across these samples, we identified seven major cell types, including tumor cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, basal cells, myoepithelial cells, and hypoxia-related cells. A total of 19,169 single cells were analyzed across 39 protein markers. Tumor cells represented the most abundant population in every sample, with counts ranging from 237 to 1,745 cells (Figure 2), reflecting the tumor-rich nature of the dataset. In contrast, myoepithelial and hypoxia-related cells were consistently sparse.
Identification of Tumor-Specific Protein Markers
To isolate markers specific to tumor cells, we performed a Wilcoxon rank-sum test comparing expression levels of each marker between tumor and non-tumor cells. Twelve protein markers were significantly enriched in tumor cells (adjusted p < 0.01), including well-established tumor-associated proteins such as GATA3, panCK, CK8/18, PR, HER2, and Ki67 (Table 1). Notably, Ki67, a proliferation marker[a][b], exhibited the highest fold change (2.15) in tumor versus non-tumor cells, followed by GATA3 and CK8/18 (fold change >1.4), highlighting their strong discriminatory potential for malignant populations. This set of markers served as the basis for developing a predictive classification model.
 

Tumor Cell Classification Using a Random Forest Model
Using the 12 tumor-enriched markers, we trained a Random Forest classifier to distinguish tumor cells from other cell types. The model was trained on the METABRIC IMC dataset using five-fold cross-validation and achieved high performance with an average accuracy of 89.4% and Cohen’s kappa of 0.79, indicating strong agreement beyond chance. Feature importance analysis revealed that Ki67, GATA3, CK8/18, panCK, and PR were the top contributors to the model’s performance (Figure 1), supporting their central role in tumor cell identification.
Generalization to In-House IMC Dataset
To evaluate the generalizability of the trained classifier, we applied the model to an independent in-house IMC dataset comprising 10 samples. Following the same normalization strategy, cells were annotated based on the model’s predictions and compared to manual annotations. The classifier achieved an overall accuracy of 81.5%, with a sensitivity of 59.6% and specificity of 92.7% (Table 2). While the model excelled at correctly identifying non-tumor cells (high specificity), it exhibited a moderate drop in sensitivity, reflecting a degree of heterogeneity or possible marker expression divergence in the in-house cohort. Nonetheless, the classifier retained a balanced accuracy of 76.1%, suggesting that the tumor-defining protein signature is broadly conserved and functionally relevant across independent IMC datasets.
