Distinct Cell Type Compositions Characterize Moderate and Critical COVID-19 Patients
To investigate how COVID-19 severity correlates with immune-epithelial dynamics, we analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data from 27 patients (14 moderate and 13 critical cases) derived from the Chua et al. dataset . A total of 132,618 cells spanning 13 annotated cell types were included following subsetting for moderate and critical severity.
We first examined the cellular composition of individual samples (Figure 1). While most samples contained a diverse repertoire of cell types, notable differences were observed in their relative abundances between severity groups. Neutrophils, goblet cells, and T cells were among the most prominent cell types. Goblet cells were especially enriched in moderate patients[a], whereas critical cases exhibited a marked increase in neutrophils and macrophages[b]. These compositional shifts suggest a potential imbalance in epithelial and immune populations that could underpin disease severity.

Increased Monocyte-Neutrophil Crosstalk in Critical Patients Revealed by Cell-Cell Communication Profiling
We next sought to infer intercellular communication patterns using CellChat, a computational framework that predicts ligand-receptor interactions from single-cell gene expression data. Aggregated communication matrices were generated for each severity group and compared to identify differential intercellular interactions (Figure 2).
The heatmap of differential communication intensity (critical minus moderate) revealed widespread rewiring of the cellular interaction landscape. Notably, monocyte-to-neutrophil interactions were substantially elevated in critical cases, with an increase of +0.25[c][d] in communication score. Similarly, basal cells showed broad upregulation in interactions across multiple targets, particularly toward basophils/mast cells (+0.25) and ciliated cells (+0.13).[e][f] In contrast, goblet-to-T cell communication was diminished in critical samples, implying a loss of potentially protective epithelial-immune crosstalk in severe disease.

Divergent Ligand-Receptor Signaling Patterns in Moderate vs. Critical Disease States
To uncover the molecular underpinnings of these altered cell-cell interactions, we analyzed ligand-receptor pairs ranked by interaction probability within selected sender-receiver pairs that differed by disease severity.
In moderate patients, goblet cells exhibited strong interactions with innate and adaptive immune populations (Figure 3a). The top-ranked interaction was ANXA1–FPR1 between goblet cells and neutrophils (interaction probability: 0.49), followed by ANXA1–FPR1 and MIF–(CD74+CD44) targeting monocytes and macrophages, respectively. Notably, antigen presentation via HLA-A/B/C–CD8A/B pairs was prominent in goblet-to-T cell communication, suggesting that epithelial antigen presentation might contribute to controlled immune activation in milder cases.
In critical patients, monocyte-to-neutrophil communication dominated (Figure 3b). High-probability interactions included ANXA1–FPR1 (0.35), CCL3–CCR1, CXCL3–CXCR2, and SPP1–(ITGA5+ITGB1). These ligands are associated with chemotaxis, inflammation, and leukocyte adhesion, indicating a hyperinflammatory state driven by myeloid cell activation. Many interactions involved the CXCL-CXCR axis (e.g., CXCL1/2/3/5 with CXCR1/2), aligning with previously described neutrophil hyperactivation in severe COVID-19【PMID: 32697968[g]】.

Summary
These results highlight the dual nature of epithelial-immune interactions in shaping COVID-19 severity. Moderate disease is characterized by diverse epithelial interactions, particularly goblet-mediated communication with adaptive and innate immune cells. In contrast, critical cases exhibit a shift toward monocyte-driven signaling targeting neutrophils, consistent with excessive inflammatory responses.
The upregulation of inflammatory chemokine signaling in critical patients mirrors clinical hallmarks of severe COVID-19, including neutrophilia and cytokine storm. Conversely, the reduction in goblet–T cell interactions in critical patients suggests a loss of mucosal immune homeostasis. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the cellular communication networks underlying disease progression and identify potential therapeutic targets for modulating epithelial-immune crosstalk.
