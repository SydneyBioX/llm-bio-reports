Single-nucleus RNA Sequencing Reveals Dynamic Gene Expression Changes Following Spinal Cord Injury
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing was performed on neurons from the mid-thoracic spinal cord of mice at various time points post-injury, including uninjured controls, 1 day, 4 days, 7 days, 1 month, and 2 months, to investigate the transcriptional response to spinal cord injury. The dataset comprised 17 injured and 3 uninjured samples. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction effectively separated cells by both condition and time point, visually demonstrating the impact of injury on the spinal cord transcriptome and the temporal progression of gene expression changes (Fig. 1).  
Differential Expression Analysis Identifies Key Genes Affected by Spinal Cord Injury
Differential expression analysis using the Limma package identified genes with significant changes in expression across the time course of spinal cord injury. The top 10 differentially expressed genes are shown in Table 1 (full list in Supplementary Table 1). Notably, several genes associated with lysosomal function, including Psap, Ctsb, Hexa, and Tpp1, were among the most significantly downregulated. Lysosomal dysfunction is increasingly implicated in neurodegenerative processes and may contribute to the cellular response to injury. For example, Cathepsin B (Ctsb), a lysosomal protease, has been shown to play a role in inflammation and cell death pathways[a] in the central nervous system.  
Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis Reveals Perturbation of Key Biological Processes
To gain insight into the functional consequences of the observed gene expression changes, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed separately for upregulated and downregulated genes.  
* Downregulated genes were significantly enriched in categories related to synaptic function, including "regulation of synapse structure or activity" and "postsynapse organization" (Fig. 2). This suggests that spinal cord injury leads to a disruption of synaptic signaling and plasticity, potentially contributing to functional deficits.  
* Upregulated genes showed enrichment in categories such as "regulation of membrane potential" and "regulation of innate immune response" (Fig. 2). The enrichment of "regulation of innate immune response" is consistent with the known inflammatory response that follows spinal cord injury.  
Summary of Key Findings
In summary, our analysis of single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from the injured mouse spinal cord revealed significant time-dependent changes in gene expression. These changes implicate lysosomal dysfunction, synaptic disruption, and immune activation as key biological processes affected by spinal cord injury.
